Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. They requested me to design a game application called Draw It or Lose It. They requested that this application be extended to multiple plaftorms as well.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like I was clear in defining requirements and highlighting pros and cons of each platform when presenting the company with options.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Writing the design document kept the goals in focus and helped guide decisions on what tasks are most important compared to others.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel like I could have done a better job in comparing the different operating platforms. I was able to do alot of research on all the platforms available but I definitely have more to learn.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I used the information and requirements already available from the company to do tasks at an interval pace, splitting up the work required. It is important to keep the tasks in order and only work on as few tasks at a time as possible to not overload yourself
and cause a backlog of tasks to slow you down. It is also important to consider the user's needs when designing because if the user is not happy with the product then they will no longer use it or recommend it, and without users the product is useless.
